    <p>When the toxins are present in the soil in an amount high enough to pose serious threats to health is referred to as soil pollution.</p>
    <p>CAUSES:
        The soil whether it is polluted or unpolluted contains organic and inorganic substances in it that are present naturally in soil. When the level of these organic and inorganic compound exceeds the level of natural limit due to soil microbial activity, decomposition of organisms and wind activity leads to soil pollution.
        
        The two main causes of soil pollution are:
        
        ANTHROPOGENIC (MAN-MADE) CAUSES: Man-made soil pollution is usually caused by industrial activities, improper disposal of waste and agriculture pesticides.
        NATURAL CAUSES: Accumulation of any toxic chemical in the soil due to decomposition or organisms and microbial activity.</p>
    <p>EFFECTS:
        Soil pollution causes serious health implications for plants, animals, and humans. The effect is generally based upon the type and concentration of pollutant inhaled. And it also depends upon the age and health status of a person. The major diseases caused by soil pollution are headache, nausea, fatigue, skin rashes and eye irritation by inhaling the gases present in the soil.</p>
