<p><h1><center>AIR POLLUTION</center></h1> 
    <p>Air is an important abiotic factor that plays a vital role in respiration. It is a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and inert gases.  Oxygen is important in the Combustion process. Nitrogen and Carbon dioxide are utilized by plants to perform its metabolic processes. Air contains about 99% of all these gases, but when the ratio is disturbed it contributes to Air Pollution. The introduction of harmful and poisonous substances (pollutants) into the air referred to as Air Pollution. These toxic substances are present at that higher level that they pose serious health issues.
    </p>
    <p>CAUSES:
        The root cause of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuel during cooking, driving and many other industrial activities release many chemicals the air every day thus polluting it.
        Smog and soot are the most prevalent air pollutants.
        Smoke from the chimneys and factories, burning of wood due to coal burning release Sulphur dioxide in the air.
        Nitrogen Oxide is produced from the fertilized farmlands and is polluting the air.
        Paints, hairspray, varnish, aerosol spray, and some solvents produce fumes. Fumes also tend to pollute the air.
        Methane is being generated from water deposition in landfills. Methane is a highly flammable gas and tends to displace oxygen in the enclosed areas which often leads to asphyxia and suffocation.
        Carbon dioxide, Sulphur dioxide, methane, and nitrogen dioxide, when released in the air are mixed with some other chemicals and thus contribute to Acid Rain production.</p>
    <p>EFFECTS:
        Air pollution causes detrimental effects on the lives of people. According to a journal that is published in the Environmental Research Letter, air pollution kills almost 2 million people per year. But the effect of air pollution on human health vary widely depending on the nature of pollutants. For example, if the pollutant is an irritant, it would cause respiratory problems and cardiovascular diseases.
        
        In 1984, methyl isocyanate gas was released in Bhopal that killed almost 2,000 people and 200,000 people suffered from respiratory problems.</p>
    <p>Air pollutant emission factors are reported representative values that aim to link the quantity of a pollutant released into the ambient air to an activity connected with that pollutant's release.[3][77][78][79] The weight of the pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or time of the activity generating the pollutant is how these factors are commonly stated (e.g., kilogrammes of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned). These criteria make estimating emissions from diverse sources of pollution easier. Most of the time, these components are just averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and they are thought to be typical of long-term averages.</p>
    <p>Pollutants emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include:
    
        Ammonia: Emitted mainly by agricultural waste. Ammonia is a compound with the formula NH3. It is normally encountered as a gas with a characteristic pungent odor. Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals. Although in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous.[87] In the atmosphere, ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur to form secondary particles.[88]
        Carbon dioxide (CO2): Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the atmosphere, essential for plant life and given off by the human respiratory system.[89] However, it is potentially lethal at very high concentrations (typically 100 times "normal" atmospheric levels).[90][91] Although the World Health Organization recognizes CO2 as a climate pollutant, it does not include the gas in its Air Quality Guidelines or set recommended targets for it.[92] Because of its role as a greenhouse gas, CO2 has been described as "the worst climate pollutant".[93] However, statements such as this refer to its long-term atmospheric effects rather than shorter-term effects on such things as human health, food crops, and buildings. This question of terminology has practical consequences, for example, in determining whether the U.S. Clean Air Act (which is designed to improve air quality) is deemed to regulate CO2 emissions.[94] That issue was resolved in the United States by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which specifically amended the Clean Air Act "to define the carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels as an 'air pollutant.'"[95] CO2 currently forms about 410 parts per million (ppm) of earth's atmosphere, compared to about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times,[96] and billions of metric tons of CO2 are emitted annually by burning of fossil fuels.[97] CO2 increase in earth's atmosphere has been accelerating.[98] CO2 is an asphyxiant gas and not classified as toxic or harmful in general.[99] However, workplace exposure limits do exist in places like UK (5000 ppm for long-term exposure and 15000 ppm for short-term exposure).[91] Natural disasters like the limnic eruption at Lake Nyos can result in a sudden release of huge amount of CO2 as well.[100]
        Carbon monoxide (CO): CO is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas.[101] It is a product of combustion of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. Vehicular exhaust contributes to the majority of carbon monoxide let into the atmosphere. It creates a smog type formation in the air that has been linked to many lung diseases and disruptions to the natural environment and animals.
        Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): Emitted from goods that are now prohibited from use; harmful to the ozone layer. These are gases emitted by air conditioners, freezers, aerosol sprays, and other similar devices. CFCs reach the stratosphere after being released into the atmosphere.[102] They interact with other gases here, causing harm to the ozone layer. UV rays are able to reach the earth's surface as a result of this. This can result in skin cancer, eye problems, and even plant damage.[103]
        Nitrogen oxides (NOx): Nitrogen oxides, particularly nitrogen dioxide, are expelled from high temperature combustion, and are also produced during thunderstorms by electric discharge. They can be seen as a brown haze dome above or a plume downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO2. It is one of several nitrogen oxides. One of the most prominent air pollutants, this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor.
        Odors: Such as from garbage, sewage, and industrial processes.
        Particulate matter/particles (PM), also known as particulates, atmospheric particulate matter (APM), or fine particles, are microscopic solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas.[104] Aerosol, on the other hand, is a mixture of particles and gas. Volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living plants, and sea spray are all sources of particles. Aerosols are produced by human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels in automobiles, power plants, and numerous industrial processes.[105] Averaged worldwide, anthropogenic aerosols – those made by human activities – currently account for approximately 10% of our atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease,[106] altered lung function and lung cancer. Particulates are related to respiratory infections and can be particularly harmful to those with conditions like asthma.[107]
        Persistent organic pollutants, which can attach to particulates. Persistent organic pollutants are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation due to chemical, biological, or photolytic processes (POPs). As a result, they've been discovered to survive in the environment, be capable of long-range transmission, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and pose a major threat to human health and the ecosystem.[108]
        Persistent free radicals connected to airborne fine particles are linked to cardiopulmonary disease.[109][110]
        Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs): a group of aromatic compounds formed from the incomplete combustion of organic compounds including coal and oil and tobacco.[111]
        Radioactive pollutants: Produced by nuclear explosions, nuclear events, war explosives, and natural processes such as the radioactive decay of radon.
        Sulfur oxides (SOx): particularly sulfur dioxide, a chemical compound with the formula SO2. SO2 is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and their combustion generates sulfur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO2, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO2, forms H2SO4, and thus acid rain is formed. This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.
        Toxic metals, such as lead and mercury, especially their compounds.
        Volatile organic compounds (VOC): VOCs are both indoor and outdoor air pollutants.[112] They are categorized as either methane (CH4) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere. This effect varies depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use.</p>

    <p><h1><center>Water Pollution</center></h1>
        <p>The contamination of water bodies such as lake, river, streams, oceans or other stretches of water by harmful substances is referred to as water pollution. It is the contamination of water bodies by human activities.

        There are two types of water pollution:
        
        Organic Pollution caused by microorganisms like viruses and bacteria.
        Chemical Pollution caused by pesticides, chemicals used in industries, human and animal drugs, and by heavy metals.</p>
    <p>CAUSES:
        Unexpectedly, humans are primarily responsible for water pollution. Water can be easily polluted because it is a universal solvent that can dissolve almost every substance present in the universe. Thus, toxic substances are also dissolved in it leading to water pollution.
        
        Marine dumping is one of the major causes of water pollution. Garbage like plastic, glass, paper, aluminum, and rubber is deposited in the sea that is eaten up by the aquatic organisms leading to their death. Moreover, these substances take hundreds of years to be decomposed thus cause water pollution.
        Industries release a large amount of chemical waste that is drained into the water bodies.
        Radioactive waste is generated by power plants and uranium mining that lingers in the environment for thousands of years. The release of these substances in groundwater, surface water, and marine water threatens the aquatic life.
        Agriculture can be affected by the use of pesticides, insecticides, fungicides which leads to water pollution as these substances are drained in the water bodies.
        Inadequate Sewage and wastewater systems as more than 80% of wastewater go back to the environment without being treated and reused.</p>
    <p>EFFECTS:
        ON THE ENVIRONMENT: The addition of toxic substances in the water results in eutrophication that badly affects the aquatic life An increase in the temperature of water bodies due to thermal pollution leads to global warming that causes hazards to water organisms.
        
        ON HUMAN HEALTH: Diseases such as Diarrhea, Cholera, Typhoid, Dysentery, and skin infections are caused by drinking contaminated water.</p></p>
