        <h1><center>Noise Pollution</center></h1>
        <p>Also known as sound pollution or environmental noise pollution is defined as the progression of noise with detrimental effects on humans and animals.</p>
        <p>According to a general rule, any sound louder than 80 decibels is hazardous. But in our daily lives, we are repeatedly exposed to heavy noise produced by:
            Heavy traffic
            Emergency sirens
            Loud Music
            Jet plane
            Fireworks
            Gunshots
            Industrial machinery
            Tractor</p>
        <p>EFFECTS:
            Noise pollution is considered as a mere nuisance. When we are exposed to a sound above than 80 decibels, our eardrum can be affected, and hearing loss can occur.</p>
