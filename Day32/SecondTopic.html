        <h1><center>Water Pollution</center></h1>
        <p>The contamination of water bodies such as lake, river, streams, oceans or other stretches of water by harmful substances is referred to as water pollution. It is the contamination of water bodies by human activities.

        There are two types of water pollution:
        
        Organic Pollution caused by microorganisms like viruses and bacteria.
        Chemical Pollution caused by pesticides, chemicals used in industries, human and animal drugs, and by heavy metals.</p>
    <p>CAUSES:
        Unexpectedly, humans are primarily responsible for water pollution. Water can be easily polluted because it is a universal solvent that can dissolve almost every substance present in the universe. Thus, toxic substances are also dissolved in it leading to water pollution.
        
        Marine dumping is one of the major causes of water pollution. Garbage like plastic, glass, paper, aluminum, and rubber is deposited in the sea that is eaten up by the aquatic organisms leading to their death. Moreover, these substances take hundreds of years to be decomposed thus cause water pollution.
        Industries release a large amount of chemical waste that is drained into the water bodies.
        Radioactive waste is generated by power plants and uranium mining that lingers in the environment for thousands of years. The release of these substances in groundwater, surface water, and marine water threatens the aquatic life.
        Agriculture can be affected by the use of pesticides, insecticides, fungicides which leads to water pollution as these substances are drained in the water bodies.
        Inadequate Sewage and wastewater systems as more than 80% of wastewater go back to the environment without being treated and reused.</p>
    <p>EFFECTS:
        ON THE ENVIRONMENT: The addition of toxic substances in the water results in eutrophication that badly affects the aquatic life An increase in the temperature of water bodies due to thermal pollution leads to global warming that causes hazards to water organisms.
        
        ON HUMAN HEALTH: Diseases such as Diarrhea, Cholera, Typhoid, Dysentery, and skin infections are caused by drinking contaminated water.</p>
