    <body><h1><center>RadioActive Pollution</center></h1>
    <p>When the radioactive substances are released into the environment as a result of a nuclear explosion, nuclear weapon testing, production and decommissioning, mining, disposal of nuclear waste results in radioactive pollution.
    </p>
    <p>CAUSES:
        Accidents at the nuclear power plant
        Nuclear weapon testing
        Mining of radioactive ores
        Disposal of nuclear waste
        Nuclear weapons used as weapons of mass destruction
        Radioisotopes</p>
    <p>EFFECTS:
        As the people handling the radioactive isotopes are exposed to the radiation, this exposure may lead to DNA damage. The damage depends upon the degree of exposure.
        Mutation at the genetic level:
        Diseases: Cancer is the dominant disease that can be caused by exposure to radiation.
        Soil infertility: Disposal of the radioactive substances into the soil makes it infertile.</p>
